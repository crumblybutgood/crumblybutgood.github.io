The idea behind `Crumbly But Good` is one of finding richness and joy in the messy imperfections of our universe.

Take the name, `Crumbly But Good`, this phrase, uttered almost in passing by Carl Sagan in episode 9 of the series _Cosmos_, acknowledges that the pie is not a simple thing. _Crumbly_ is an adjective which means "Easy to break into small fragments". The contraction, _but_, implies that, in spite of its crumbliness, the pie remains _good_.

Crumbliness is an integral part of pastry and is not typically regarded as a negative attribute which makes the typically contrarian contraction seem potentially out of place. Had the contraction been _and_, the phrase _crumbly and good_ would provide little opportunity for additional complexity given that the episode describes the life cycle of stars and the basic elements of which they are composed. _And_ reduces the crumbliness to a simple attribute of the pie and could have been easily replaced with _warm_, _aromatic_ or _gooey_. Prefacing the episode about atoms and stars with something that is crumbly, breaking down into an immensely complex collection of smaller pieces, and yet it remains good, allows the complexity to exist as it is, without judgement. There is a simplicity to _good_ which pairs well with the chaos of crumbliness. That juxtaposition of the simple and the chaotic provide the canvas upon which the Universe and all of its richness can be explored.

Let's explore.
